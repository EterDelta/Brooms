# Brooms Mod [![curseforge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/brooms.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/brooms)


**Simple, enchantable, and balanced brooms in Minecraft.**

Brooms adds brooms, simple vehicles to handle. Press space to fly, and when the flight time runs out, you will automatically return to the ground and recharge it similarly to Terraria mounts.
